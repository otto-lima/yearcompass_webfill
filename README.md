# Year Compass Web: A Digital Journey of Reflection

[](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/)

## About This Project

Year Compass Web is an unofficial, fan-made project that brings the wonderful experience of the Year Compass booklet into an interactive web platform. As huge admirers of the original work by the Year Compass team, our goal was to create a digital space where users can privately reflect on their past year and thoughtfully plan the year ahead.

This application guides you through all the sections of the traditional booklet, allowing you to fill them out online and, upon completion, generate a beautiful PDF summary of your personal reflections and goals.
